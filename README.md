# hello-world
My first repository!

I'm Thingyman, but because that name was taken, I'm Thingyman-DEV! I currently know HTML, and am, currenently learning C++ and CSS. I also plan t learn Javascript and Python. I enjoy watching baseball, basketball, and football. I also enjoy reading and programming little widgets. I want to help better the coding community!
